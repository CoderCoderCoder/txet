# TXET: a reverse text adventure
This is an experiment in interactive storytelling, based on text adventure games. You provide the adventure, and the computer will act basically at random.

As an example, try typing something like:
'You find yourself in a small room. There is a key on a table, and a door to the north.'
You can write as many paragraphs (lines) as you like. Pressing return on a blank line will allow the computer to act.

End your adventure by writing 'The End.' on its own line. You can write more on the same line, but the adventure will end after you press return.
